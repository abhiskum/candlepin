/**
 * Bootstrapper for our functional tests.  This class is a little different from a normal Spring Boot
 * application. It does not do a component scan nor does it enable auto-configuration.  Instead, it just
 * creates a single ApplicationRunner bean, {@link JUnitBootstrap}, that invokes JUnit.
 *
 * The JUnit tests should all be annotated with {@link FunctionalTestCase}.  That annotation will create a
 * Spring ApplicationContext defined by {@link FunctionalTestConfiguration}.  FunctionalTestIntegration also
 * has component-scan enabled, so other classes annotated with @Component (or its kin) will also be loaded
 * into the BeanFactory.
 *
 * The main point to remember is this: This test harness has <strong>2</strong> ApplicationContexts.  One
 * is defined by this class and should only be the beans necessary to get JUnit up off the ground.  The
 * other is created for each test by virtue of the FunctionalTestCase class and consists of beans defined
 * in FunctionalTestConfiguration <strong>and every class annotated with @Component (or equivalent)</strong>
 *
